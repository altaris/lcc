"""
Module dedicated to fining LCC targets.

LCC is all about detecting and correcting misclustered samples. Detection occurs
at the clustering stage, see `nlnas.correction.clustering` and specifically
`nlnas.correction.clustering.otm_matching_predicates`.

Then comes the question of correction. Misclustered samples are pulled towards a
_target_ that is itself correctly clustered (and in the same class). This module
is dedicated to finding and/or choosing these targets.

    Derives the clustering correction loss from a tensor of latent
    representation `z` and dict of targets (see `nlnas.correction.lcc_targets`).

    First, recall that the values of `target` (as produced
    `nlnas.correction.lcc_targets`) are `(k, d)` tensors, for some length `k`.

    Let's say `a` is a missclusterd latent sample (a.k.a. a row of `z`) in true
    class `i_true`, and that `(b_1, ..., b_k)` are the rows of
    `targets[i_true]`. Then `a` contributes a term to the LCC loss equal to the
    distance between `a` and the closest `b_j`, divided by $\\\\sqrt{d}$.

    It is possible that `i_true` is not in the keys of `targets`, in which case
    the contribution of `a` to the LCC loss is zero. In particular, if `targets`
    is empty, then the LCC loss is zero.

    Usage:

        ```python
        targets = lcc_targets(
            dl,
            y_true,

            before passing it to this method.  The correctly samples and the
            missclustered samples are automatically separated.

            labels.
